## About

This is a quiz I designed to text the users' knowledge of the Impressionim Art. I was able to figure out the following features:

1. When the user clicks on the start button, the timer starts, the total time to answer questions will be 2 mins.
2. When the quiz starts, the user is presented with a set of questions.
3. When the user chooses an answer, the screen is going to show the correct answer in green, and wrong answer in red.
4. When the game is over, the page leads to a leaderboard where the user can input his/her name and the leaderboard will show the users' name once submit.

## Problems I've encountered:

1. Timer cannot work properly when the answer is wrong, it's supposed to have a 5 second punishment on the timer, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do that.
2. The leaderboard is not fully functional with the current version, a deeper dive on append() method is needed.

## In conclusion

I'll keep working on how to deal with the problems I have right now. Will probably resubmit the homework later.
